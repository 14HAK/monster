  <h1>Simple White Cake!</h1>
  <p>This simple cake recipe was sent home from our children's school. It is the easiest, best-tasting cake I've ever
    made! It's great to make with the kids, especially for cupcakes. Use your favorite frosting on top of this delicious
    cake.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 ¾ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon table salt</li>
    <li>½ cup whole milk, room temperature</li>

    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square
      cake pan.</li>
    <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until lighter in color and fluffy, 3 to

      15 seconds.</li>
    <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. With mixer on low speed, add flour mixture to butter
      mixture in 3 batches, alternating with milk, beginning and ending with flour. Mix just until combined stopping
      to scrape down sides if needed, about 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Spread cake batter into the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

      remove pan and let cake cool completely before frosting. Enjoy!</li>
